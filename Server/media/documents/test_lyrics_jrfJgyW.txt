Verse 1
I wake up every morning with a smile on my face
Life is beautiful, moving at my own pace
The sun is shining, birds singing their song
Everything's perfect, nothing could go wrong

Chorus
Happy days are here to stay
All my troubles fade away
Dancing in the summer rain
Never felt so good again

Verse 2
Got my friends beside me, family close too
Every moment precious, everything brand new
No more worries, no more pain
Living life like a sweet refrain
